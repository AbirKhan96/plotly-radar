The code follows Tutorial from following :-

https://plot.ly/python/polar-chart/#polar-scatter-plot-with-goscatterpolar

Note :-

The Hardcoded values are not suggested.You can improve the project by passing a dynamic list in following data list

r = [692,27,3.01,24.33,11.32],  theta = ["svrly_stntd", "svr_wstg", "wasting_percent", "stunting_percent", "underweight_percent"],

and made a config file instead of variables.

I explain the possible ways to improve this.Now it's upto you to improve structure of code.

Thanks.
